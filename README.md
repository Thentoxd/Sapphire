Sapphire
===========

High-performance Paper fork that aims to fix gameplay and mechanics inconsistencies.

Sapphire is built with performance in mind, and includes optimizations and improvements to the core server software that can help reduce lag and improve overall server performance. Additionally, Sapphire includes a range of customization options that allow server administrators to tweak various settings and parameters to optimize their server for their specific needs.

One of the key features of Sapphire is its support for plugins and mods. With Sapphire, server administrators can easily install and manage plugins and mods, allowing them to add new gameplay features and functionality to their servers. Sapphire also includes a range of built-in plugins and tools to help administrators manage their servers, such as a powerful permissions system, chat filters, and anti-griefing tools.

Sapphire is also designed with scalability in mind, and can be easily scaled to support large-scale Minecraft networks and communities.
